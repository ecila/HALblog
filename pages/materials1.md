### Useful info for the day

#### Archives

Examples from the two data sets used for the Kaggle Challenge on day two are available online:  
  + The [50 voices 50 faces](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/fiftyyears/50voices50faces) is an oral history collection celebrating Sussex University's 50th anniversary  
  + [Sisterhood](http://www.bl.uk/sisterhood) is a set of oral history interviews featuring activists of the Womenâ€™s Liberation Movement  
  Both will be introduced by [Margaretta Jolly](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/16251)

#### Python Workbooks
The python notebooks and all libraries can be downloaded from the HAL Git repo [https://github.com/algolistening/distantListening](https://github.com/algolistening/distantListening).  

You will need to install [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/), set it running, then run start.sh which will launch the notebook. You can then access it at localhost:8888 (it should provide a URL for the first visit).

Thanks to [Parag Mital](http://www.algorithmiclistening.org/participants/#KM) for setting this up for us.
