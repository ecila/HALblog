### Interdisciplinary perspectives: Deep & Distant Listening
April 27-28. Sussex Humanities Lab, University of Sussex, Brighton

The first workshop aims to lay the foundations for an interdisciplinary research agenda by bringing together researchers and practitioners from across music, humanities and computer science research to share archival, technical and critical perspectives on algorithmic listening.

* *What are the challenges and opportunities of working with large digital audio databases for humanities researchers, sound artists and archivists?*
* *How is machine listening being applied in other areas of research and practice and what can we learn from this?*
* *What are the cultural, epistemological or phenomenological implications of technologically mediated listening?*
* *How can ideas from the history of philosophy of technology be applied to productively shape ethical and technical designs in the future?*
* *How readily can digital audio software tools designed to classify, categorise and predict be used to afford discovery, reveal insights and new interpretations of sonic data?*
* *What new approaches to the design of Listening Algorithms might historical or critical perspectives inspire? What new approaches to humanities research do Listening Algorithms inspire?*
