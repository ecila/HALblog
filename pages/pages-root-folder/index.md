From oral history to media archaeology, sensory ethnography to ecology, researchers are increasingly interested in what can be learned from the acoustic environment and from sonic, as well as textual resources; at the same time, computational methods afford opportunities to engage with sonic materials in new ways. This network brings together diverse disciplinary perspectives to consider the technical, epistemological and creative possibilities, as well as culture and ethical implications, of listening with and through algorithms.

Existing machine listening algorithms are capable of tasks such as recognising melodies, identifying instruments or musical genres. Their capacity is evidenced by commercial products which are becoming at once more powerful, more complex and their inner workings more opaque. Advances in computational power must be accompanied by critical consideration: what does it to means to listen through / with algorithms? What new ways of listening are afforded? What kinds of relationships do we want to have? and how does this inform the way we design algorithms for future cultural, epistemological and creative applications?

This network brings together experts with an interest in the applications and implications of machine listening from diverse disciplines including oral history, sensory ethnography, archive services, computer science, philosophy and music technology. The principle aim is to develop an interdisciplinary research agenda for the future design and application of listening algorithms in research and everyday life.
