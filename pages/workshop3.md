### Future Implications and Applications of Algorithmic Listening
Sept 14-15. University of Sussex, Brighton   

*What relationship do we want to have with listening algorithms in the future and how do we go about achieving this?*

Part of the third and final workshop for the AHRC Humanising Algorithmic Listening Network will be dedicated to workshopping ideas from network members and affiliates for future practice and research.  We invite proposal sketches for consideration and can offer small development funds (e.g. travel and/or materials).


### Scope and format
Proposals should address Future Algorithmic Listening -- in research, practice or culture. This may be broadly imagined. Practice-based, critical, empirical or multidisciplinary methods are all welcome. Proposals should be no more than 1-side of A4 and include: a research question, outline of methods, and justification for costs (e.g. travel to meetings, room hire, materials purchase) etc.  

### Deadlines
Up to 6 projects will receive up to Â£500 each. Outlines to be emailed to halnetwork9000@gmail.com by August 24th 2017. Notification Aug 28th
