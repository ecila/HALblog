      Alice Eldridge is a musician and interdisciplinary researcher. A background in music, psychology (BSc), evolutionary and adaptive systems (MSc) and informatics (PhD) informs wide-ranging creative, technological and scientific research in the composition and decomposition of sonic environments. She has published and presented at conferences internationally across music, computing and soundscape ecology. As a cellist she has performed internationally at the intersection of contemporary classical, improvised, folk and avant garde musics, including as one-quarter of award winning Collectress and is a vibrant member of Brighton and London free improv scenes. She has appeared on BBC radio 1 as a pop bassist, BBC radio 3 as a contemporary classical composer and free jazz cellist, BBC radio 4 and prime-time BBC 2 TV as a soundscape ecologist; her field recordings feature on Janek Schaefer’s foundsoundscape.com. Her work in all domains is driven by a simple joy in the absorbing powers of listening and an interest in technologies and techniques for broadening it’s scope.

      <p>
Trevor Agus is an auditory psychologist who just wanted control over sounds in a way that made sense to his ears. His research career started by investigating why specifically complex listening situations were particularly challenging for many older listeners. Zooming in, he showed that we use rather complex spectrotemporal cues even in simple, everyday listening tasks, such as recognising that a voice is a voice. Yet more fundamentally, he researches why different snippets of white noise generally sound the same by investigating the rare exceptions. He is currently interested in the psychoacoustics of mixing, with a view to adapting mixes for hearing-impaired listeners.

      <p>
      Theo Burt produces sound, video and light works for live performance, installation, screenings and published media. Adopting a range of aesthetics, he works extensively with unpredictable and automatic processes to produce geometric and synthetic audio-visual performances, recorded music and transformations of existing music and media. By selecting processes that leave traces of both the source material and the process itself, the results are divorced of a single context, unplaceable, familiar and unfamiliar.
 
      His most recent album Gloss (Presto!?, 2015) used early digital hardware synthesisers to create looped music fragments. His current Remix performances and installations continue the work of his album Summer Mix (Entr'acte/Death of Rave, 2011/2015) transforming existing anthemic dance material into new forms. Recent work has focussed on large scale light and sound installations, including "The War Will Feed Itself" in the turbine hall at VAC's Geometry of Now project in Moscow, 2017. A new album in collaboration with Richard Sides will be released later this year.

He has performed at festivals including the collateral programme of the Venice Biennale, Piksel Bergen, Electropixel Nantes, AlgoMech Sheffield, BEAM Uxbridge and Spill Ipswich, and toured with the Rambert Dance Company performing David Tudor’s music to Merce Cunningham’s Rainforest. He contributed to the design of The Prayer Companion - a piece exhibited twice at the Museum Of Modern Art (MoMA), New York, and acquired for their permanent collection. Amongst many musical collaborations, he works with Sten-Olof Hellström, Tim Shaw and in the noise drone band Tonesucker. John Bowers works in Culture Lab and Fine Art, Newcastle University, where he helps coordinate the Digital Cultures Research Group.

      My academic connection with computers and sound started as an undergraduate at Stanford.  Each of my close friends from my freshman dorm has gone on to make a mark in computers and sound, whether it be inventing the Shazam algorithm, founding a key Hollywood audio editing firm (Audio Mechanics), patenting a sound spatialisation chip widely used in Soundblaster cards in the 80s and 90s, or leading one of the speech recognition teams behind Google Voice.  Like them, I studied computer music under John Chowning and digital signal processing under Julius Smith.  I also studied music theory and experimental forms of music composition.  After Stanford, I worked on neural networks for speech recognition with Teuvo Kohonen in Helsinki, and at ATR in Japan.  My current related interests include expectation-based models of sensory experience, including audition, and the aesthetic and engineering challenges of answering the question:  What would it be for a robot to sing?      </p>

    <p>
 I'm a composer, improviser, researcher and programmer. My curiosity-driven work is mainly about two things: understanding the mechanisms of creativity, and developing new technologies for improvisation and composition. What is the artistic creative process like on the inside? Can we make computers behave in a similar way? How can we use new technology to create new ways to play and interact musically? Can mediated improvisation provide new qualities of musical interaction?

 I grew up in Stockholm, studied instrumental and electronic composition at the academies of Malmö and Gothenburg, and did a PhD in evolutionary computation for musical creativity at Chalmers University of Technology (2004). My music, ranging from piano solos over full orchestra to interactive software installations, has been performed on six continents, and been awarded several international prizes (e.g., Gaudeamus Prize 2001). In my research I develop new technologies for electronic improvisation and composition, and study computer models of artistic creativity. Trained as a classical pianist, I have toured extensively as an improviser on electronics and/or experimental keyboard instruments, primarily with my duo pantoMorf, but also in other constellations, e.g., together with Gino Robair, John Tilbury and the legendary AMM.

Her primary areas of expertise are the philosophy of computation, the philosophy of technology and the new emerging field of media philosophy. Beatrice’s current work investigates the limits and potentialities of formal reasoning in relation to computation, and aims to offer a re-conceptualisation of contingency within formal axiomatic systems vis-à-vis technoscientific notions of incompleteness and incomputability. This research is part of a monograph that she is currently writing on how indeterminacy shapes the ontological foundation of computational aesthetics.

      I am interested in the possibilities technology provides for music. My work is about the relationship between computation and its interpretation. I build systems from hypothetical assumptions, extrapolate models beyond their limits and set in motion possible understandings in order to learn about my own perception. I am currently finishing a solo french horn piece that explores the possibility of recovering past sounds from field recordings, starting a project to synthesize from the alphabet of Abrahamic religions the sounds of a universal language, and continuing work with dynamical systems. I attended school in Connecticut (Yale) and New Hampshire (Dartmouth), and I lived in New York City for a few years while working at S.E.M. Ensemble. I now live in San Francisco, and recently finished three and a half months of touring with Dream Team Ensemble, Happy Valley Band, and Gravies and the Main Dish Sauce.

Her work uses spoken word, field recordings and archive material to explore aspects of our listening relationship with each other and the multiverse. She is currently focused on how sound relates to the past, our histories, environment and our collective and individual memories from a feminist perspective. Aspects of her creative practice have developed out of these interests and include composition and installation-based work. She also writes and lectures on these and related subjects as well as collaborating with choreographers, film makers, visual artists and other musicians.

<p></p>
<p>
Parag K. MITAL (US) is an artist and interdisciplinary researcher obsessed with the nature of information, representation, and attention. Using film, eye-tracking, EEG, and fMRI recordings, he has worked on computational models of audiovisual perception from the perspective of both robots and humans, often revealing the disjunct between the two, through generative film experiences, augmented reality hallucinations, and expressive control of large audiovisual corpora. Through this process, he balances his scientific and arts practice, with both reflecting on each other: the science driving the theories, and the artwork re-defining the questions asked within the research. His work has been exhibited internationally including the Prix Ars Electronica, ACM Multimedia, Victoria & Albert Museum, London’s Science Museum, Oberhausen Short Film Festival, and the British Film Institute, and featured in FastCompany, BBC, NYTimes, CreativeApplications.Net, and CreateDigitalMotion.
