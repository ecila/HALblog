## LOCATION and DIRECTIONS
----

Gardner Tower, [Attenborough Centre for Creative Arts](https://www.attenboroughcentre.com/), University of Sussex, Gardner Centre Rd, Falmer, East Sussex, BN1 9RA

### Getting there   
**Train** (easiest for IBIS residents)   
The nearest station is Falmer (approx 5 minutes’ walk from there to the Attenborough Centre). The train takes nine minutes from Brighton and seven minutes from Lewes.

Trains run very regularly during the day (about every 15 minutes).

From the train station follow signs to University of Sussex – walk under the underpass and follow the footpath until you reach a zebra crossing.  Turn left here until you reach Gardner Centre Road on your right.  Turn right up Gardner Centre Road to find the main entrance of the building.  The Attenborough Centre is the building with round red brick towers.

**Bus** (may be easiest for Mercure residents)   
The number 25 and 25X bus brings you from central Brighton all the way to University of Sussex campus.  Alight at the “Sports Centre” bus stop and you will see the Attenborough Centre (building with round red brick towers) through the trees across a lawn.

**Accomodation**   
Participant accommodation is split between  [The Mercure Brighton Seafront Hotel](http://www.mercure.com/gb/hotel-8335-mercure-brighton-seafront-hotel/index.shtml) on Brighton Seafront and the [IBIS Brighton City Centre - Station](http://www.ibis.com/gb/hotel-6444-ibis-brighton-city-centre-station/index.shtml), at the station.
