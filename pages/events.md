*PUBLIC EVENTS*
### Long table -- Humanising Algorithmic Listening in Culture and Conservation
Sept 14th 20:00 as part of the [2017 Brighton Digital Festival](http://brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/events/humanising-algorithmic-listening-culture-conservation)

Inspired by the work of Lois Weaver, this Long Table discussion is a theatrical open-ended, non-hierarchical format for participatory debate. Speakers and audience switch places around a dinner table. In place of cutlery, coloured pens are provided to document discussions in drawing and/or writing on the table. Debate, dinner and theatre merge.
