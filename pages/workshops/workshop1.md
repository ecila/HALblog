### WORKSHOP 1

### Exchanging Perspectives: Machine Listening vs Listening Machines
April 27-28. Sussex Humanities Lab, University of Sussex, Brighton

This workshop aims to build cross-disciplinary understandings by sharing current capabilities of machine listening, contemporary sonic perspectives in arts and humanities research, emerging issues in audio archive management and how they might mutually influence each other.

Core Questions to address:
* *What new ways of listening might a transdisciplinary algorithmic listening afford?*
* *What are the challenges of dealing with large audio databases in humanities research?*
* *How is machine listening being applied in other areas of research and culture?*
* *What issues arise in importing methods from information sciences into humanities research?*
* *How might critical insights from the humanities inform the design of future listening algorithms?*
