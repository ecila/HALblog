      Alice Eldridge is a musician and interdisciplinary researcher. A background in music, psychology (BSc), evolutionary and adaptive systems (MSc) and informatics (PhD) informs wide-ranging creative, technological and scientific interests in the composition and decomposition of sonic environments. Current and recently funded projects include ecoacoustic machine listening for biodiversity monitoring in the Ecuadorian Amazon, development of networked notation software to support ensemble music making for young people and a hybrid luthiery project designing and building an electro-acoustic feedback cello for generative and gestural improvisation. As a cellist she has performed internationally at the intersection of contemporary classical, improvised, folk and avant garde musics, including as one-quarter of award winning Collectress and is a vibrant member of Brighton and London free improv scenes. She have appeared on BBC radio 1 as a pop bassist, BBC radio 3 as a contemporary classical composer and free jazz cellist, BBC radio 4 as a soundscape ecologist and her field recordings feature on Janek Schaefer’s foundsoundscape.com. Her work in all domains is driven by a joy in the absorbing powers of listening and a fascination with technologies for broadening it’s range.

He also works as a sound artist improvising with electronic, digital, acoustic and electro-mechanical devices and self-made instruments in performance and installation settings, typically accompanied by live digital image. His work is often grounded in field research methods drawn from the social sciences (ethnography, interaction analysis) and related to theoretical and practical issues in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), design research, material culture, media archeology and critical theory. He leads Culture Lab's research on Digital Media.

      My academic connection with computers and sound started as an undergraduate at Stanford.  Each of my close friends from my freshman dorm has gone on to make a mark in computers and sound, whether it be inventing the Shazam algorithm, founding a key Hollywood audio editing firm (Audio Mechanics), patenting a sound spatialisation chip widely used in Soundblaster cards in the 80s and 90s, or leading one of the speech recognition teams behind Google Voice.  Like them, I studied computer music under John Chowning and digital signal processing under Julius Smith.  I also studied music theory and experimental forms of music composition.  After Stanford, I worked on neural networks for speech recognition with Teuvo Kohonen in Helsinki, and at ATR in Japan.  My current related interests include expectation-based models of sensory experience, including audition, and the aesthetic and engineering challenges of answering the question:  What would it be for a robot to sing?      </p>

    <p>
 I'm a composer, improviser, researcher and programmer. My curiosity-driven work is mainly about two things: understanding the mechanisms of creativity, and developing new technologies for improvisation and composition. What is the artistic creative process like on the inside? Can we make computers behave in a similar way? How can we use new technology to create new ways to play and interact musically? Can mediated improvisation provide new qualities of musical interaction?

 I grew up in Stockholm, studied instrumental and electronic composition at the academies of Malmö and Gothenburg, and did a PhD in evolutionary computation for musical creativity at Chalmers University of Technology (2004). My music, ranging from piano solos over full orchestra to interactive software installations, has been performed on six continents, and been awarded several international prizes (e.g., Gaudeamus Prize 2001). In my research I develop new technologies for electronic improvisation and composition, and study computer models of artistic creativity. Trained as a classical pianist, I have toured extensively as an improviser on electronics and/or experimental keyboard instruments, primarily with my duo pantoMorf, but also in other constellations, e.g., together with Gino Robair, John Tilbury and the legendary AMM.

      Beatrice Fazi is Research Fellow in Digital Humanities & Computational Culture at the Sussex Humanities Lab (University of Sussex, United Kingdom). Her primary areas of expertise are the philosophy of computation, the philosophy of technology and the new emerging field of media philosophy. Beatrice’s current work investigates the limits and potentialities of formal reasoning in relation to computation, and aims to offer a re-conceptualisation of contingency within formal axiomatic systems vis-à-vis technoscientific notions of incompleteness and incomputability. This research is part of a monograph that she is currently writing on how indeterminacy shapes the ontological foundation of computational aesthetics.

Creativity Cultures in Underground Electronic Music and Software Engineering and PhD candidate at the Humboldt-University Berlin. He graduated in 2013 as Magister Artium (M.A.) at the Humboldt-University’s Institut für Kulturwissenschaft (Institute for Cultural History & Theory). His PhD project focuses on the re-development of programming as a cultural technique and computational thinking. He strives to understand the ways in which media, epistemic practices, and the formation of culture constitute each other. His interests include sound studies with special regard to sonic modes of thinking and reasoning, games and ludic practices, and the history of grammatextuality and typography. Since 2011 he is organizing a public lecture series KlangDenken (sonic thinking) in collaboration with Sebastian Schwesinger and the Sound Studies Lab.

      I am interested in the possibilities technology provides for music. My work is about the relationship between computation and its interpretation. I build systems from hypothetical assumptions, extrapolate models beyond their limits and set in motion possible understandings in order to learn about my own perception. I am currently finishing a solo french horn piece that explores the possibility of recovering past sounds from field recordings, starting a project to synthesize from the alphabet of Abrahamic religions the sounds of a universal language, and continuing work with dynamical systems. I attended school in Connecticut (Yale) and New Hampshire (Dartmouth), and I lived in New York City for a few years while working at S.E.M. Ensemble. I now live in San Francisco, and recently finished three and a half months of touring with Dream Team Ensemble, Happy Valley Band, and Gravies and the Main Dish Sauce.

Her research has been featured on the BBC World Service, and her sound work has been commissioned by ABC Radio National, Transmediale, Reina Sofia, and Live Art Development Agency. Her current projects use storytelling, field recording and data sonification to explore and document community responses to ecological violence and environmental change in the Pacific.

Using film, eye-tracking, EEG, and fMRI recordings, he has worked on computational models of audiovisual perception from the perspective of both robots and humans, often revealing the disjunct between the two, through generative film experiences, augmented reality hallucinations, and expressive control of large audiovisual corpora. Through this process, he balances his scientific and arts practice, with both reflecting on each other: the science driving the theories, and the artwork re-defining the questions asked within the research. His work has been exhibited internationally including the Prix Ars Electronica, ACM Multimedia, Victoria & Albert Museum, London’s Science Museum, Oberhausen Short Film Festival, and the British Film Institute, and featured in FastCompany, BBC, NYTimes, CreativeApplications.Net, and CreateDigitalMotion.

    Sharon Webb is a Digital Humanities Lecturer in the Sussex Humanities Lab and the School of History, Art History and Philosophy. She is a historian of Irish associational culture and nationalism (eighteenth and nineteenth century) but has also studied computer science at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. Her PhD in History, from Maynooth University (Ireland), can be described as a digital humanities project as it entailed software development as well as historical research, reflecting her background in history and computer science.
