Three workshops will be held throughout 2017:

### 1 Exchanging Perspectives: Machine Listening vs Listening Machines
April 27-28. Sussex Humanities Lab, University of Sussex, Brighton

* *What new ways of listening might algorithmic listening afford?*
  * *What are the challenges and opportunities of working with large digital audio databases for humanities researchers and archivists?*
  * *How is machine listening being applied in other areas of research and culture and what can we learn from this?*
  * *What issues arise in importing machine listening and learning methods directly from the information sciences into humanities research?*
  * *How might critical insights from the humanities -- media archeology, sensory ethnography, sonic sociology etc. - inform the design of future listening algorithms?*
