## LOCATION and DIRECTIONS
----

The Sonic Arts Research Centre, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, BT7 1NN

Queenâ€™s is a five minute walk from Botanic Train Station on the Bangor, Larne, Newry and Derry~Londonderry lines. A connection to Dublin is just one stop away, via Belfast Central Station. Coach and bus services arrive at Great Victoria Street, which is also connected by rail (or alternatively is a ten-minute walk).

SARC is up the road from the main QUB campus, just off the Malone road on a small street called Cloreen Park (not to be confused with Chlorine Gardens). SARC is the first building on the left past the barrier. The building has a waveform on the brickwork.
